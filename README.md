This is a E-Commerce (backend) web API.
Project Features:
    1.User - Create account/login/update/delete.
    2.Product- Create/read/update/dalete
       You can find products by category/colour/size
    3.Admin- admin can perform all operations.
    4.Review- One use can review one time to a product or can edit their review or can delete the review.
    5.Only admin can create products or perform CRUD operations on product/Category/Sizes etc because to perform these operations you should be admin.
    6.In this project I used MVC pattern to separate the files for clean and understandable code to update or make changes later easily.
